## 1. Executive Summary

| Parameter | Current Value | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Current Phase** | **PHASE 2 — Real-Time Event-Driven Market Intelligence & Opportunity Detection (Active)** | Real-time WebSocket event streaming (Swap/Sync/Block), selective inverted pool dispatch, sub-second to low-second latency profiling, candidate persistence, deterministic replay |
| **Current Status** | **PHASE 2 IMPLEMENTED & VALIDATED** | 144/144 tests passing (100%), typecheck clean, lint clean, security audit clean (30 files scanned, 0 private key/signing patterns), live Base WebSocket validation sweep executed: 84.6% RPC reduction, 93.1% latency reduction, 100% deterministic replay; execution strictly LOCKED |
| **Live Trading** | **DISABLED** | Structurally impossible — observer is read-only; zero signing code |
| **Development Wallet** | **Not Created** | Eligible in Phase 0/early Phase 1; strictly for dev/testnet; ₹0 meaningful funds; zero keys committed/pasted |
| **Production Wallet** | **No production wallet** | Strictly deferred to Phase 7/8; dedicated SAHIKARA wallet |
| **Production Capital** | **₹0.00** | No live funds allocated |
| **Experimental Target Capital** | **₹100.00** | Reserved for Phase 8 gated experiment |
| **Active Target Chain** | **Base (Primary Provisional)** | Polygon PoS (Secondary Provisional); Arbitrum & OP Mainnet (Secondary Candidates) |
| **Target DEXs** | **Base: Uniswap V3 (5/30 bps), Aerodrome Volatile/Stable, Aerodrome Slipstream (1/5 bps), PancakeSwap V3 (5 bps)** | All 4 DEX quoting mechanisms active, event-streamed, and verified on Base Mainnet |
| **Current Blockers** | **None** | Phase 2 validated; ready for Phase 3 (Off-chain Simulation & Profitability Engine) |
| **Last Updated** | **2026-09-16** | Phase 2 Real-Time Event Ingestion & Selective Route Dispatch (DEC-020) |
