## 1. Executive Summary

| Parameter | Current Value | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Current Phase** | **PHASE 1E — Multi-Pair / Multi-DEX Market Discovery + RPC Abstraction (Complete)** | Multi-pair configurable universe, multi-DEX pool registry, RPC provider manager, dynamic 2-hop route generator, Multicall3 batcher, pool-level database uniqueness |
| **Current Status** | **PHASE 1E IMPLEMENTED & VERIFIED** | 133 tests passing (100%), typecheck clean, lint clean, security audit clean (25 files scanned, 0 private key/signing patterns), short live Base validation complete across 3 cycles; execution strictly LOCKED |
| **Live Trading** | **DISABLED** | Structurally impossible — observer is read-only; zero signing code |
| **Development Wallet** | **Not Created** | Eligible in Phase 0/early Phase 1; strictly for dev/testnet; ₹0 meaningful funds; zero keys committed/pasted |
| **Production Wallet** | **No production wallet** | Strictly deferred to Phase 7/8; dedicated SAHIKARA wallet |
| **Production Capital** | **₹0.00** | No live funds allocated |
| **Experimental Target Capital** | **₹100.00** | Reserved for Phase 8 gated experiment |
| **Active Target Chain** | **Base (Primary Provisional)** | Polygon PoS (Secondary Provisional); Arbitrum & OP Mainnet (Secondary Candidates) |
| **Target DEXs** | **Base: Uniswap V3, Aerodrome Volatile/Stable, PancakeSwap V3 (Active)** | Aerodrome Slipstream (Stub/NOT_READY); Polygon: Uniswap & QuickSwap |
| **Current Blockers** | **None** | Phase 1E verified; ready for Phase 1F long-term multi-pair continuous collection or Phase 2 |
| **Last Updated** | **2026-09-16** | Phase 1E Multi-Pair / Multi-DEX Market Discovery & RPC Abstraction Completed (DEC-018) |
